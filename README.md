## Installation

To install **Hash Crack**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realguylovescheese/Hash_crack.git
   cd Hash_crack
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed. You can install the necessary packages using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:

   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/realguylovescheese/Hash_crack/releases) section to download the latest version. Execute the downloaded file to get started.

## Usage

Using **Hash Crack** is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you can start cracking hashes:

1. **Basic Command Structure**:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py [options]
   ```

2. **Cracking Hashes**:

   To crack a list of hashes, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --crack hashes.txt
   ```

   Replace `hashes.txt` with your file containing hashes.

3. **Brute Forcing Zip/RAR Files**:

   For zip files:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --brute-zip file.zip
   ```

   For rar files:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --brute-rar file.rar
   ```

4. **Using Wordlists**:

   To use a custom wordlist, specify it with the `--wordlist` option:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --crack hashes.txt --wordlist my_wordlist.txt
   ```

## Supported Hash Algorithms

**Hash Crack** supports various hash algorithms, including:

- **MD5**
- **SHA1**
- **SHA256**
- **SHA512**
- **Blake2b**
- **Blake2s**
- **RIPEMD160**

Each algorithm has its unique properties and uses, making it essential to choose the right one for your needs.

## Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. **Hash Crack** provides robust support for brute forcing zip and rar files. Here‚Äôs how to utilize this feature:

1. **Brute Force Zip Files**:

   Use the following command to initiate a brute force attack on a zip file:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --brute-zip myfile.zip
   ```

2. **Brute Force RAR Files**:

   For rar files, the command is similar:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --brute-rar myfile.rar
   ```

This method can take time, depending on the complexity of the password and the power of your machine.

## Wordlist Attack

A wordlist attack uses a predefined list of potential passwords to crack hashes. This method is generally faster than brute force for many cases. To perform a wordlist attack, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Wordlist**: Create a text file containing possible passwords, each on a new line.

2. **Execute the Attack**:

   ```bash
   python3 hash_crack.py --crack hashes.txt --wordlist my_wordlist.txt
   ```
